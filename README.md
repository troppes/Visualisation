by [Julian Bechthold](https://github.com/Huliandos) and [Florian Reitz](https://github.com/troppes)

This repository contains our files for the visualisation module at HTW in 2021.

### Vis01 - Circle Game
In this game the goal is to match the written size difference of the shape as closely as you can.

### Vis02 - Preattentive perception
In this game the goal is to click on the outlier.

### Vis03 - Car Watcher
This is a visualisation of a list of cars given by the professor.

## Installation and running

To build and run the program please use 'mvn clean javafx:run' within the project folder.

## Thanks

A big thanks to Filip Papranec for his [car logo repo](https://github.com/filippofilip95/car-logos-dataset), which we used for Vis03.
